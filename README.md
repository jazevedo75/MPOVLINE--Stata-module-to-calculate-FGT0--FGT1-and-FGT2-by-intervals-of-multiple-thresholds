# MPOVLINE: Stata module to calculate FGT0, FGT1 and FGT2 by intervals of multiple thresholds

## Abstract

mpovline calculates FGT0, FGT1 and FGT2 by intervals of multiple lines. This ado can be used to calculate headcount for the poor, vulnerable and middle class lines as proposed by Ferreira et al (2012), and the respective FGT1 and FGT2 as implemented by Azevedo and Sanfelice (2012).
